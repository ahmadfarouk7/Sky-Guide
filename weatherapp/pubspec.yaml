  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - Assets/images/
    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nerko_One
      fonts:
        - asset: Assets/Fonts/Nerko_One/NerkoOne-Regular.ttf
    - family: Zilla Slab
      fonts:
        - asset: Assets/fonts/Zilla_Slab/ZillaSlab-Bold.ttf
    - family: Roboto Condensed
      fonts:
        - asset: Assets/Fonts/Roboto_Condensed/RobotoCondensed-VariableFont_wght.ttf
        #   style: italic
